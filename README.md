Hello! Juan Bermeo here!

Today I'm bringing my first app project done for Android using Android Studio.

The purpose is pretty simple: a Tip Calculator.

This app will help you calculating the tip of your meal depending on the percentage you would like to give: 15%, 20% or 25%.

Also, a PartySize value is incorporated whenever you are with friends and you would like to split the check/bill amount.

This app was done with a minimum SDK: API 22: Android 5.1 (Lollipop).


Important Aspects to mention:

	* Each computation is done with Math.round() method which rounds up the quantity.
	* Each Field will not accept empty values (""), negative values (# < 0) nor str values.
